# Logistic Regression Model for Binary Classification
This project demonstrates the implementation of a logistic regression model for binary classification using Python and scikit-learn. The model predicts whether an input belongs to one of two classes.

Prerequisites
Before running the logistic regression model, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>=3.6)
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Getting Started
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/logistic-regression-binary-classification.git
cd logistic-regression-binary-classification
Prepare your dataset:

Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the filename of your dataset in the data folder. Make sure the dataset has a target column (the variable you want to predict).

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open and run the logistic_regression.ipynb notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the logistic regression model on your dataset.

Usage
After training the model, you can use it to make predictions on new data by calling the predict method. You can integrate the model into your own applications for binary classification tasks.

python
Copy code
# Load the trained model (if not already loaded)
model = joblib.load('trained_model.pkl')

# Make predictions on new data
new_data = pd.read_csv('new_data.csv')  # Load your new data
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
Evaluation
You can evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. The evaluation results are available in the Jupyter Notebook logistic_regression.ipynb.

Customization
Feel free to customize the model or adapt it to your specific binary classification problem. You can modify the features, hyperparameters, or data preprocessing steps according to your requirements.
